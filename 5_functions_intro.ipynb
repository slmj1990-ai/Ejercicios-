This reduces code duplication and promotes modularity.\n","- Readability: Breaking down a program into smaller functions makes it easier to read and understand. Each function represents a specific task or functionality, making the overall program flow more intuitive.\n","- Modularity: Functions encapsulate specific tasks, making it easier to modify or update them without affecting other parts of the program.\n","- Debugging and Testing: Functions help isolate specific sections of code, making it easier to locate and fix issues. They also facilitate testing since we can test each function individually.\n","\n","## Best Practices\n","\n","- Function Naming: Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose or functionality of the function.\n","- Function Length: Keep functions concise and focused on a single task. Aim for shorter functions that are easier to understand and maintain.\n","- Function Documentation: Provide a docstring at the beginning of the function to describe its purpose, parameters, and expected output. This helps other programmers (and yourself) understand how to use the function.\n","- Avoid Global Variables: Functions should ideally operate on their input parameters and return values, rather than relying on global variables. This promotes encapsulation and reduces dependencies. When we say \"avoid global variables,\" it means that we should try to limit the use of variables that are defined outside of functions and are accessible from any part of the program. Instead, we should aim to use variables that are passed into functions as parameters and variables that are returned as the output of functions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"m3xSfpQsF-wP"},"source":["# Exercise"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vM2Do4_5F-wP"},"source":["\n","Create a function named \"generation_calculator\" to help determine the generation you belong to according to your birth year.
